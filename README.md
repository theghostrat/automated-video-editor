Welcome to the Automated Video Editor repository! This is a cool tool that helps you edit your videos without needing to be a pro at video editing. If you've just started using GitHub, don't worry â€“ we'll guide you through the basics.
What is Automated Video Editor?

Automated Video Editor is a program that makes video editing simpler. It's like having a helper that can trim your videos, add smooth transitions, and even make shaky videos look steady.
Getting Started

Follow these steps to start using the Automated Video Editor:

    Download the Code

    If you're new to GitHub, the "code" is the set of instructions that make the Automated Video Editor work. Click on the green "Code" button above, then select "Download ZIP." This will get you the code on your computer.

    Get Ready

    To run the Automated Video Editor, you need to have a special program on your computer called Python. If you don't have it, you can download it for free from python.org. During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH."

    Install Dependencies

    Open the "Terminal" or "Command Prompt" on your computer. This is like a chat window where you can talk to your computer using text. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the code using the cd command. For example:

    bash

cd path/to/automated-video-editor

Then, type the following and press Enter:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

This tells your computer to install the special tools the Automated Video Editor needs to work.

Edit Your First Video!

Still in the Terminal or Command Prompt, type a command like this:

bash

    python video_editor.py input_video.mp4 output_video.mp4 --trim --transition fade --stabilize

    Replace input_video.mp4 with the name of your video file and output_video.mp4 with the name you want for your edited video.

    You can use different options like --trim, --transition, and --stabilize to choose what the Automated Video Editor should do.

    Find Your Edited Video

    After the script runs, your edited video will be saved as output_video.mp4 in the same folder where you have the code.
